The AABL Lab works at the intersection of assistive technology and social robotics (including socially assistive robotics): we are especially interested in robots interacting with users under-served by typical HRI research, such as children, older adults, and people with disabilities. Ultimately, our work gives robots the intelligence to understand what people want, make good decisions about how to help, and to help appropriately in real-world interactions.
