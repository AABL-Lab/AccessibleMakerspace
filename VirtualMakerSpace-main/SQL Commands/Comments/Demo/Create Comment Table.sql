VALUES (123, 'Jake Lawton', 'Theodore R. Sizer is an American public school teacher turned education critic and writer of the acclaimed Horace Series.  In the Horace Series, Sizer lays out his critique of the public school system and how he would change it.  In Horace’s Compromise, Sizer describes his observations and critiques of the public school system.  Prior to writing the series, Sizer used his own experiences and the observations he collected when visiting many American high schools to inform his critique.  His overarching critique is that high school is too easy and does not stimulate or properly challenge students; furthermore, the assignments that students are given are usually rote memorization, require no independent thought, and pertain little to the real world.  Students learn, both directly and indirectly, that what matters is their attendance, which is required to get their diploma, which is required to operate in everyday life. 
Sizer wishes to change this reality by changing what, how, and why students are taught.  Sizer would scale back the number of departments in the high school to only 4 and broaden their horizons.  These departments would be Inquiry and Expression, Mathematics and Science, Literacy and Arts, and Philosophy and History.  He would have the assignments that educators hand out focus more on synthesizing these skills and not focus on any one skill independently.  He recommends that assignments should be more open-ended, allowing each student to create their own view on what the assignment is asking and how they want to answer.  Students must demonstrate mastery of the material, not just regurgitation of what has already been said.  Students would be challenged to work independently and learn for themselves.  Teachers would act more like coaches, helping students on work to increase their ability and spend less time lecturing to them.  Ultimately, Sizer wants students to learn that what matters most is that they learn new material, they learn how to learn, and they realize that through learning, they will be prepared for life.
To accomplish this goal, Sizer did more than just discuss theory.  In another book in the Horace Series, Sizer gives many concreate examples of assignment, or “exhibitions,” that he would give to students in an ideal public school system.  We looked at four of these assignments: “Emotions”, “Form 1040”, “Two Projects”, and “Knowledge in Use”.  In “Emotions”, students are required to identify an emotion of their choosing and using three different forms of artistic expression, explore this emotion in depth.  This assignment causes students to develop skills in finding and developing themes in artistic work.  In “Form 1040”, students are given the complete history of a family’s financial records and their 1040 tax form from the previous year.  In groups, students then compile all this information to fill out the 1040 form.  They will be “audited” by another student and an expert and must describe and defend their findings.  This assignment requires students to be able to properly compile and record data in a useful way for analysis.  In “Two Projects” students are given two year-long projects of their choosing to complete.  The projects are very open-ended, and students are required to keep a journal of their experience and describe how they could be making improvements.  In this assignment, students learn long term goal setting and planning skills, in addition to getting a taste of what the real world is like.  In “Use of Knowledge” students are given an excerpt of a Supreme Court decision to analyze.  They must state what they believe is the context of the decision, the subject of the case, and what the excerpt is saying.  They also must relate this to a hypothetical modern day Supreme Court case and express what they would do if they were in the judge’s position.  This assignment requires students to think critically about the historical context of the decision, display an understanding of the role of the Supreme Court, and to relate historical events to the modern day.  Individually, the exhibitions address several aspects of Sizers critiques at the expense of others.  No one assignment encapsulates everything Sizer would have an assignment achieve.  However, when viewed as a whole, the assignments are a strong example of Sizer’s recommendations to remediate critiques in public school assessments. 
One of the first and most important areas these assignments need to be assessed for is their compatibility to students and their learning style.  This is important because if the assignments are not reasonably able to be completed by students, they will get discouraged and will learn that they don’t have what it takes to succeed or catch up to where they need to be.  Sizer said as much in his book, and I had this experience recently with a data science course.  So how do the assignments stack up in terms of their compatibility to high school learners?  Short answer is it varies.  “Two Projects”, “Form 1040”, and “Use of Knowledge” should all be compatible with most high school students, given proper preparation and coaching.  In “Form 1040” the mathematical concepts are simple; however, book-keeping and numerical analysis are emphasized in this real-life example of why math is critical to learn.  Since most adults will need to learn the concept of income and taxes at some point, applying simple math concepts in this use case assignment should not be too much of a stressor on the students.  “Two Projects” should also be completable as well.  Many students in my high school had capstone projects their senior year that were very similar to Sizer’s project, except they were only one semester in length.  Given that I have seen my high school peers complete these kinds of long-term, multi-discipline projects, then with proper preparation, it should be completable by most high school students.  “Use of Knowledge” requires thematic understanding, knowledge of historical context, extrapolating these themes and contexts to a modern setting, then rendering a “what-would-you-do” scenario.  Many of these subskills are taught in high schools today.  The main difference of this assignment would be to pull them all together.  This would be a leap, but not an insurmountable leap for most students.  In 8th grade we had to synthesize several historical documents into a solid essay about their significance, and we did this weekly.  In high school junior year Advanced College Prep (ACP) history, we had to spend time learning about a modern-day movement and analyzing it in terms of the aspects of the movements we learned about that occurred in the past.  These assignments display some of the skill required in “Use of Knowledge.”  “Emotions” is the one assignment where completability becomes tricky.  This assignment required three different artistic expressions of a theme.  The problem here is with the sheer volume of artistic skill the students will have to display.  To become masterful at one art form can take years of practice.  To become masterful at three would put a huge strain on a student’s schedule.  If this assignment was a graduation requirement, then the practice required to master 3 art forms leave little time for the work assigned by the other three departments, let alone other things like spending time with family, taking care of oneself, working an after-school job, participating in extra-curriculars or sports, and having a little time left over for recreational activities.  The “Emotions” assignment might be modified for completability either by reducing the number of art forms to master or allowing for experimentation and trial with various art forms rather than mastery.  Aside from “Emotions,” these assignments should be reasonable to complete by many high school students, and with some tweaks, “Emotions” could be as well.  Of course, the compatibility of these assignments to students will be dependent on the quality of preparation, coaching, and resources available to them, as Sizer describes in his books.   
What does Sizer believe are the main critiques of schools and their assignments in the current system?  The most significant gaps he identifies are that assignments should be open-ended, and students need freedom to work independently and complete them as they see fit; assignments need to have opportunities for coaching; assignments should attempt to synthesize skills learned in their department or cross department; and assignments need to provide valuable incentives and engage students in learning.  Each of these aspects is important and interdependent to achieve learning objectives.  Assignments should be open-ended because in real life, there is rarely if ever one answer to a given problem.  Even in something very rigid and mathematical like algorithms, there are multiple different algorithms and approaches to solve a problem.  Coaching throughout the assignment is vitally important because it is the only and best way to learn a new skill.  Musicians, athletes, and the RMV require routine practice with a coach because this method ensures learners understand how they can improve.  In my guitar practice, my instructor gave me tips on how to practice effectively, and since then my results have dramatically improved.  Synthesizing different skills is important because in the real world, most things worth while require abilities from different fields.  For example, in computer science, the student needs to be comfortable in mathematics, but also needs to be good at communicating and expressing ideas as well as good at listening and learning from others.  If one creates an awesome algorithm but can’t effectively describe how it works, then it is effectively useless to the industry.  Finally, the assignment needs to provide a valued incentive, so students want to complete it and engage in the learning while doing so.  If there are no valuable incentives or engagement in learning, then students will simply do the bare minimum to achieve their goal of not failing and won’t learn anything.  Now that we have established why these are important criteria for an assignment, we will look at each of Sizer’s assignments individually to see how they stack up.
“Emotions” is a good assignment since it is very open-ended and engaging, has indirect but valuable incentives for completion, synthesizes several ideas well.  Although there are clear opportunities for coaching, these are not clearly stated.  In addition, this assignment will assist students in observing thematic development in their other work and creating it in their own.  This skill can be extrapolated out to non-fiction scenarios, like observing a recurring viewpoint of underlying bias of a news organization or discovering a person’s perspective by analyzing what music they listen to or what books they read.  This assignment synthesizes expression, the arts, inquiry, and even history very well.   The latter two come from students having to look for examples from other sources of art, literature and history for definitions and expressions of their emotions.  The only field it leaves out is math and science.  Where this assignment falls short is in its opportunities for coaching.  The opportunities are there, they are not stated, however.  For this assignment, students should be given help finding a mentor who has experience with the artform they select, who can help them plan their work, answer questions and critique when necessary.  This coaching will also allow students to take more risks with their creativity since they will be able to get help if they don’t know where to begin with that idea.  An example of this was a photo competition in high school where students were required to recreate a photo taken with an uncommon technique.  No one was participating since no one even knew where to begin.  My friend and I were given a hint to rethink something we had already done in the class.  From this we were able to extrapolate everything we needed to complete the competition.  Ultimately this is a solid assignment.  It accomplishes most of the goals well, and with a few tweaks can correct most of its deficiencies.
“Two Projects” is an excellent assignment.  It is very open-ended, having plenty of incentives for completion, engaging to students, with coaching opportunities clearly stated, and even though it does not directly relate to any of Sizer’s departments, most if not all of them will be pulled in by the nature of the project.  The incentive for this project is that it will partially take place in the real world and will directly prepare the students for what they will face once they leave school.  This real-world, practical application of learning is also highly engaging.  Because the project is very open-ended, it allows students to customize it to what personally interests them.  While it isn’t directly apparent how this assignment relates to Sizer’s academic departments, it could be argued that any of these “Two Projects” assignments will relate to all of them.    For example, Sizer’s projects of helping a small contractor develop his business has elements across all academic departments.  Helping manage the hours, the books, logistics, materials, and expenses all have a mathematical, data recording and analysis component.  These skills will be put to the test when the students attempt to optimize these details to assist in growth.  When it comes to advertising and improving customer experience, students will learn verbal communication, artistic expression, and writing skills.  The “Two Projects” assignment is an outstanding example of the reforms Sizer seeks to make to public school  assessments.
In my opinion, “Form 1040” is the weakest assignment of the bunch.  It has clear incentives and is a good real-world application of mathematics and logical thinking, but the assignment is constricted in its outcomes and won’t really engage the students all that much.  Although there are opportunities for coaching, they are precluded by the current design of the assignment. The incentive is clear, this is a practical application of mathematics and students will have to fill out this form for the rest of their lives.  However, the engagement is likely to be low.  This is because there isn’t really any personal expression and creativity in the majority of the assignment.  Most of the assignment is logistics, organization, and doing fairly simple math.  The saving grace of the assignment is the part about explaining the financial situation of the family.  For this part, students will need to organize the data and analyze it in unique and creative ways.  For this section of the assignment, students will have to inquire into the meaning behind many of the financial records and learn how to properly express their findings.  This part of the assignment is much more open-ended than the rest and due to this and the creativity required it will be more likely to engage the students than the rest of the assignment.  The coaching for this assignment is perhaps the biggest shortfall.  The assignment talks about bringing in experts, but they will only audit the finding after the assignment is turned in.  This means that these experts won’t be helping the students correct their failings or answer questions with the assignment as they happen, and will only get this feedback after they turn the assignment in.  Working in groups makes up for this a little, but if the auditors were allowed to assist the students even to a limited extent before the submission of the assignment, this would greatly help the coaching aspect of the assignment.  Despite this assignment having clear incentives and being a good real-world application of mathematics, the lack of freedom, the low synthesis of topics, and especially the lack of real time feedback and coaching holds this assignment back from reaching its potential.
“Knowledge in Use” has clear and important incentives, it should be engaging for many students, it gives some opportunity for synthesis and the results are open-ended.  Similarly, this assignment is held back by the lack of coaching.  The opportunities are there, but they aren’t capitalized upon in the current rendition.  The main incentive is that by completing this assignment, you will gain the ability to look at a historical decision and evaluate on its context, its meaning, who it is talking about, and extrapolating this to a modern context.  This will give students the ability to better learn about history and how to apply the learnings and philosophy of the past to a modern setting, creating more civically minded and engaged students.  This assignment will be engaging to many, but for the students who don’t really care about politics, philosophy or history, this assignment will fall flat.  This assignment is very open-ended because the exact context for the excerpt is not given.  This means that the students can place it anywhere in the country’s history they see fit and pertain it to any group of people they can relate it to.  When extrapolating it to a modern context they can relate it to any issue and when developing their own decision on the matter, they are free to answer as they choose.  The main drawbacks would be the minimal coaching and the lack of synthesis, but in some ways adjusting these would ruin the spirit of the assignment.  The main opportunities for coaching are helping the students with their reasoning and expression of their ideas.  Any more than this and the assignment would become worse as a result.  You can not tell the student when and what this excerpt is from, nor what modern issue to relate it to as that would ruin the creativity.  Despite the assignment having some shortcomings, these do not affect the quality of this assignment and it is an overall excellent example of the types of work that Sizer believe should be done in schools.
Now that the assignments are assessed on Sizer’s merits, they need to be evaluated for how they prepare students for college and specifically, being prepared  for an education here at Tufts.  You can split hairs and claim that the lack of foreign language requirement might disadvantage students who want to pursue that field, or how the level of mathematical rigor is below the level that will be required for engineering and STEM students, but overall these assignments fill much of the void in the difference between high school and college education.  On the mathematics comment, there is a class that my friend helped to develop, who’s purpose is to get students up to speed with all the math they need to know to begin a math related career here at Tufts.  From my understanding, this is the case for many of the majors.  Much of the science learned by STEM majors happens at Tufts through classes like Physics 1 and 11.  I am an engineering student, so that is the lens from which I am analyzing this question, but I assume much of the same holds true for Arts and Sciences as well.  Many of the project I have undertaken, especially in higher level classes are open-ended.  Even though there is a proper outcome, how you get to this outcome is up to you.  The expectation is that you will figure things out with the tools and instruction that were given to you.  The faculty and TAs will help you think through the assignment, and will help you debug, but the core is created by the students.  This is similar to the assignments that Sizer provides.  In Sizer’s assignment, you are left to figure things out mostly or entirely on you own.  In engineering, during senior year there is a year long capstone project.  This project is required for graduation and should incorporate elements of everything that was learned at Tufts.  This project nicely parallels the “Two Project” assignment.  Many of the skills picked up in the completion of “Two Projects”, such as long-term planning and persistence will be exceedingly helpful in completing the capstone project.  Despite the specifics being different between Sizer’s exhibitions and Tufts assignments, their goals and expectations are spiritually related, and Sizer’s assignments will close the gap between college and high school level work.
 Despite the successes of the assignments and their ability to prepare students for college, the changes to teaching and the structure of the school need to be considered.   For this we are going to look at the structural changes that needs to be made to my Alma Mater, Newton South High School (NSHS).  NSHS has already taken steps that bring it closer to the schools that Sizer would design.  One of the things that Sizer mentions in his book is that he would merge Math and Science into one department.  At NSHS, the Math and Science department have a program called the Davinci program.  In this program, Math, Science and Art are brought under one banner.  One teacher is given the responsibility of teaching students both Math and Science in tandem and the students take these concepts learned and apply them artistically.  In junior year my friend who was part of the program built a model naval vessel for the program.  The History and English departments had a program called the Global Program.  One of my favorite teachers was the mastermind behind the creation of this program.  Aside from some of the details being different, the main difference between these programs and Sizer’s are that these programs at NSHS are currently opt in.  To accommodate these assessment projects, NSHS should commit to these programs, and revise curriculum across all departments accordingly.  This would give the programs the proper attention they need to thrive.  Furthermore, the art department would need to be better coordinated.  My photo teacher often complained on how the art department is constantly scattered with no real guiding force.  This allows teachers to focus on what they think is important, but it also prevents the department from building skills that are constant across art form or combining two art forms in unique ways.  I will note that it is important that each art form retain some form of autonomy.  For example, there are some incredibly unique tricks that can be done in photography that other art forms have a tough time emulating.  These techniques should be taught in addition to a skill like portrait creation that can be completed by many art forms.  A better organization of the art department would allow for better preparation for projects like “Emotions” that require certain skills to be developed across art form.  In addition, I would change the way the Track system is implemented.  Currently, NSHS has 3 tracks, College Prep, Accelerated College Prep, and Honors courses, for all grades, then adds in Advanced Placement classes in the senior year.  The main changes I would make would be to combine honors and ACP programs into one class.  This would help to ensure that all students are being provided with the same set of skills and it would give students less comfortable with the material the chance to learn from students who are more comfortable.  This is necessary to ensure that all students come to the table with the same skill set when beginning Sizer’s assignments.  What would change for the honors students would be the rigor that their work is being evaluated, and they would be given extra or more challenging assignments, to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the material being covered.  This situation worked quite well in classes like the Davinci and Global Program, and classes with low attendance like Latin.  In my Latin class, the honors students were permitted less mistakes on exams.  This made sure that all students had the same set of skills when going into the next level of Latin, but also students who were more comfortable with the material would be challenged appropriately.  I also found that I personally benefited by being able to ask questions of the students who had a better grip on the material.  There would be challenges to this change, but not insurmountable with creativity and commitment.  
Now that we discussed how I would change the school structure to accommodate these projects, we need to discuss how I would have to teach differently myself.  First off, I would have to switch from lots of lectures in class to more group work time.  In Math and Science classes students should be working on problems and doing labs.  I would spend less time lecturing and more time designing in-class group work and then coaching student groups as they worked independently.   This way the students have time to practice the skills I am teaching them, and I would have an opportunity to check in with them and help them address questions or errors that are confounding their work.   This will give a tighter feedback loop while learning the fundamentals and should help them feel more comfortable with the skills which will prepare them for the homework.  In History and English classes, I would give students time to discuss their ideas.  By sharing their ideas and listening to other people, they will have their ideas challenged and they will provide constructive feedback.  This will help them to learn from dialog and iron out their reasoning before attempting any homework assigned.  To make sure they came to discussion prepared, I would collect some notes from the students that they created for the discussion.  In general, the class would be more project based.  Care will have to be taken to slowly ramp up the difficulty and scope of the assignment to properly acclimate the students to the level of work required for Sizer’s assignments.  This is similar to what was done in English I at Tufts, where we had progressively larger and larger assignments with progressively more independently acquired knowledge, until our 7-page research paper.  This slow ramp approach is challenging and a better technique than some of my high school experiences where large assignments were given with no preparation.  With all this in mind, to prepare students for these assignments, I would allow for more in-class work time, and slowly build up to the level of work required for these projects.
Finally, I would advocate and recommend Sizer’s ideas about learning and assessment projects to the principal at South.  I believe these assessment projects will help students be prepared for college, they would better engage and challenge the students, and since the school has already started down the path to integrating some of these teaching practices, the final commitment for school-wide change should be less disruptive.  Sizer’s critiques for how he believes schools should teach and what types of assignments they should give for learning assessment are good ones.  Aside from a few gems, most of the assignments given at South are closed, easy to predict, and revolve around regurgitation.  Many students can complete these assignments without really learning or engaging with the material.  Sizer’s assignments would be a vast improvement, even if they will require a change in teaching style and structure as described earlier. Newton South is already close to achieving these changes.  This would make the transition far more completable than other schools that are still using traditional styles of teaching.  It is because of this relative ease of transition, the benefits of the changes that adjusting the structure of the school and teaching style would bring, and the merits of the assignments on their own right, is why I would recommend these assignments to the principal of South.
	Ultimately, Sizer’s goal is to create a school that serves the students, where teachers are excited to teach and prepare students with the necessary skills and knowledge for further academic pursuits and the real world.  To do this, he created a set of assignments that are designed to achieve this vision.  In general, these assignments are excellent examples of the types of assignments that Sizer was going for.  They build skills that complement each other and teach students to work independently.  Implementing these assignments is not as simple as giving them as final projects.  Smaller assignments will have to be given with similar goals in preparation to these.  The structure of the school itself would have to be changed.  The number of departments would have to shrink, and the traditional track system would have to be abandoned.  Even for schools who have started to make progress in these regards, committing to the change would still pose a serious challenge.  However, due to the quality of the exhibitions and the benefits they would give to students, they should be adopted by any school who is serious about providing students with an engaging and successful learning experience.
